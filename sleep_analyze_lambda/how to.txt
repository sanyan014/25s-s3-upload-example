HOW TO UPDATE THE IMAGE CONTAINER FOR THE ANALYZE LAMBDA FUNCTION 

had to create a docker image container because it was too large with the packages and dependencies to upload on aws as a zip file. 

1. cd sleep_analyze_lambda
1. run docker build -t sleep-analyze-local . in the terminal 
2. run "aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 050451361230.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
    to login to the account
3. run "docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t 050451361230.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sleep-lambda:latest --push --provenance=false --output=type=image ."
